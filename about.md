<p>Family counselor and expressive arts therapy practitioner</p>

<p>The systemic approach explores family and social frameworks in which we grow up. Considering the context in which an individual lives, I try to identify recurring themes, narratives and power dynamics that can cause internal and external conflicts.
As I completed education in expressive arts therapy (EARTH), I also use the principles of Gestalt and Art psychotherapy, focusing on feelings and reactions that the client brings with him to the space, while staying attuned to the the "here and now". Through exploring family dynamics, empathy and creativity, we learn to establish authentic contact with ourselves and others.</p>
