<p>Family counselor and expressive arts therapy practitioner</p>

<p>Hi! I am Nela Grahek, a counselor working from an integrative perspective, that draws upon various therapeutic modalities to support people navigating emotional challenges. The systemic approach I use, explores family and social frameworks in which we grow up. Considering the context in which an individual lives, I try to identify recurring themes, narratives and power dynamics that can cause internal and external conflicts.
In addition to the systemic approach, I have found my place in creative therapeutic methods that incorporate metaphors and visual arts. As I completed education in expressive arts therapy (EARTH), I also use the principles of gestalt and art psychotherapy, focusing on feelings and reactions that the client brings with him to the space, while staying attuned to the "here and now". Through exploring family dynamics, empathy and creativity, we learn to establish authentic contact with ourselves and others. Expressive arts therapy offers a sense of freedom that allows me to engage both my own creativity and support others in accessing theirs. It provides an alternative to more cognitively focused approaches, shifting away from overanalysis toward expression and embodied insight. 

</p>
