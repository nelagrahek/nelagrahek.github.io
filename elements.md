<p>Family counselor and a systemic psychotherapist under the supervision of the Association of Systemic Therapists (AST). Before focusing on family psychotherapy, she graduated from the Department of Sociology, Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade.

The systemic approach explores family and social frameworks in which we grew up in. Considering the context in which the individual lives, I try to identify recurring themes, narratives and power dynamics that can cause internal and external conflicts.
As I attended an education in expressive art therapy (EARTH), I also use the principles of Gestalt and Art psychotherapy, focusing on feelings and reactions that the client brings with him to the space and following what is happening in the "here and now". Through exploring family dynamics, empathy and creativity in the therapeutic process, we learn to achieve authentic contact with ourselves and others.</p>
