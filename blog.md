<p>Expressive Arts Therapy is an integrative therapeutic approach that uses a variety of creative tools — such as visual art, movement, music or creative writing — as tools for self-expression and exploration. This approach is grounded in the belief that everyone has an innate capacity for creativity that can be ulocked. Unlike traditional talk therapy, expressive arts therapy emphasizes the act of creating as a way to access thoughts, feelings, and experiences that may be difficult to express verbally. Within this method, the therapeutic relationship is shaped like a triangle: involving the client as creator, the therapist as a support, and the artwork as an essential third component. The meaning of the artwork unfolds gradually as the client engages with it. Through this creative process, hidden or unconscious material often emerges and comes into awareness. This opens pathways for insights that may not be reachable through words alone and is particularly effective for those who have experienced trauma, stress, or emotional challenges. Its flexibility allows it to meet people where they are, offering a non-verbal and often liberating space for healing.</p>
