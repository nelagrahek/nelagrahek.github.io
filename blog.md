<p>Expressive arts therapy is an integrative approach that uses a variety of creative tools — such as visual art, movement, music or creative writing — as tools for self-expression and exploration. It invites a different kind of dialogue, one that takes place through shapes, colors, images, and symbols. These visual expressions often reveal emotional truths that may be difficult to articulate with words alone. The art-making process becomes a space for reflection, integration, and discovery. 
Expressive arts therapy is grounded in the belief that everyone has a capacity for creativity that can be ulocked. It provides an alternative to cognitively focused approaches, supporting the release of creative blocks and encouraging free expression. In both group and individual settings, I facilitate creative processes that help individuals address emotional or creative obstacles. Through this process, hidden or unconscious material often emerges and comes into awareness. This opens pathways for insights that may not be reachable through words alone and is particularly effective for those who have experienced trauma, stress, or emotional challenges. Its flexibility allows it to meet people where they are, offering a non-verbal and often liberating space for healing.</p>
